                <h3>How to cook?</h3>
                <p>Mix the dry ingredients. Sift the flour, baking powder, and salt in a small mixing bowl. Use a whisk to stir the ingredients and make sure they are fully incorporated. <br />Combine the wet ingredients. In a large mixing bowl, cream the butter and sugar using a hand or stand mixer, or by vigorously mixing the ingredients with a spoon or spatula. Keep beating or stirring the ingredients while you slowly add the egg whites to the mixture. Add the vanilla and milk and continue mixing until all of the wet ingredients are combined.</p>

                <h3>How to cook?</h3>
                <p>Peel the apples and cut them in half through the stem. Remove the stems and cores with a sharp knife and a melon baler. Slice the apples crosswise in 1/4-inch thick slices. Place overlapping slices of apples diagonally down the middle of the tart and continue making diagonal rows on both sides of the first row until the pastry is covered with apple slices. (I tend not to use the apple ends in order to make the arrangement beautiful.) Sprinkle with the full 1/2 cup of sugar and dot with the butter.</p>

                <h3>How to cook?</h3>
                <p> Wash the rice thoroughly but don't wash it so forcefully that the rice grains crack. Do not wash the rice in hot water and never use soap. Next, rinse the rice with water. Repeat the process about 3 times.  Soak the rice in water for 30 minutes to one hour before cooking.  Cook the rice. While the rice is cooking, combine the vinegar, sugar, and salt in a separate bowl. Place the rice in the handai and slowly pour the vinegar mixture over the rice. Use the shamoji in a slicing motion to thoroughly blend the rice and vinegar mixture. Be careful not to press the rice with the shamoji. While mixing it, fan the rice with the uchiwa to remove any excess moisture.</p>
